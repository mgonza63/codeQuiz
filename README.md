# codeQuiz

This is a simple Code quiz made with javascript, it is able to identify correct answers. Every time you get a wrong answer it takes 15 seconds away from your time/score. It contains 5 questions to test you coding knowledge and at the end you can see your score.
This project still need some work done, but I like the results. Enjoy!
